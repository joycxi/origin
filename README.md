## Overview
Working with the terminal command line is a key skill to develop as a programmer. Since you'll be using the command line on a daily basis, you should be comfortable using it. In this deliverable we'll be using the command line to create and organize a file tree representation of the Star Wars universe. Let's explore the Star Wars narrative using the command line!

## Getting Started
* `Fork` and `clone` this repository and `cd` into it.
* Open this directory in VS Code with:
    * `code .`

## Instructions
* There are three files: `act1.sh`, `act2.sh`, `act3.sh`. One for each act. 
* Within each act, there are prompts for each command (or group of commands) that need to be executed.
* Once you have successfully completed a command, type your command underneath its respective prompt in the .sh files.

## Save the Rebellion!
* start in `act1.sh`
* In this act, we will introduce the star wars universe with the Rebellion, Empire, Death Star, Darth Vader, and Emperor Palpatine!
* At the end of `act1.sh`, your file tree should look like this:

## Act 2
* We are introduced to our heroes!
* After Princess Leia calls on Obi-Wan for help, Han Solo, Chewbacca, Luke Skywalker, and Obi-Wan join forces and fly to the Death Star on the Millenium Falcon to rescue her from Darth Vader
* At the end of `act2.sh` your file tree should look like this:

## Act 3 
* After managing to successfully rescue Princess Leia, our heros learn that they cannot escape the Death Star's tractor beam
* Obi-Wan is able to shut it off, but in the process he is caught in a duel with Darth Vader
* How will our heroes prevail?
* At the end of `act3.sh` your file tree should look like this:

## You did it! The Rebellion is saved (for now...)!

## Submission

After you have completed the homework, make sure you are in the `u1_hw_star_wars` folder in your terminal (you may need to `cd` into that folder), and run the following commands, one at a time, in order:
```sh
git add .
git commit -m 'completed homework'
git push origin main
```

Pull requests are due next day following the [PR Submission Guidelines](https://github.com/FEWD-3-14/template_pull_request). If you aren't sure how to do this yet, just wait. We will cover it in class!
